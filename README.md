First, I designed the template of a website and define Links for each of the menu, I also put my avatar and try to make a design like connected to the header by matching the background color, but I didnâ€™t do change the style of a design because I was not sure if we could change it or not so I tried to follow the design that shows in the Demo.
Each element of the page and the way they look like, I follow the DEMO.
I designed a banner and tried to I did set the link for some of my past projects, but for more information I also give the address of my website to see more. I tried to show how they can access to my resume be defines as an <iframe>. I defined alt attribute for images and banner 
In CSS, I created variable for one of my colors to show how to use the Css variable and other CSS lessons we had like media queries, flex box, classes and DIVs.
